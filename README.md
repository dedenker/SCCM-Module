SCCM powershell Module 3.0

Created by : Stephane van Gulick (@stephanevg)
Website : www.PowerShellDistrict.com

The SCCM PowerShell module version 3.0 contains today 79 cmdlets for managing the SCCM 2007 infrastructure whith PowerShell (through WMI).

Since WMI is still the underlying technology used by SCCM 2012, a great part of the cmdlets (or logic) can be re-used for SCCM 2012 management.
And will be extended to 2012, at the moment making sure all needed functions are present.
Then start working on a 2012 version.

The module is provided "AS IS", use at your own risk.
